Each thread block uses cub\+::\+Block\+Radix\+Sort to collectively sort its own input segment. The class is specialized by the data type being sorted, by the number of threads per block, by the number of keys per thread, and implicitly by the targeted compilation architecture. ~\newline


The cub\+::\+Block\+Load and cub\+::\+Block\+Store classes are similarly specialized. ~\newline
 Furthermore, to provide coalesced accesses to device memory, these primitives are configured to access memory using a striped access pattern (where consecutive threads simultaneously access consecutive items) and then {\itshape transpose} the keys into a \href{index.html\#sec4sec3}{\texttt{ {\itshape blocked arrangement}}} of elements across threads.

Once specialized, these classes expose opaque {\ttfamily Temp\+Storage} member types. ~\newline
 The thread block uses these storage types to statically allocate the union of shared memory needed by the thread block. (Alternatively these storage types could be aliased to global memory allocations).

 \doxysubsubsection*{Stable Releases}

C\+UB releases are labeled using version identifiers having three fields\+: {\itshape epoch.\+feature.\+update}. The {\itshape epoch} field corresponds to support for a major change in the C\+U\+DA programming model. The {\itshape feature} field corresponds to a stable set of features, functionality, and interface. The {\itshape update} field corresponds to a bug-\/fix or performance update for that feature set. At the moment, we do not publicly provide non-\/stable releases such as development snapshots, beta releases or rolling releases. (Feel free to contact us if you would like such things.) See the \href{http://nvlabs.github.com/cub}{\texttt{ C\+UB Project Website}} for more information.
